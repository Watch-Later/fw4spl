FW4SPL Team

## Describe your organization ##

The FW4SPL Team includes the core development group and user support
contributors.

FW4SPL is a component-oriented architecture with the notion of role-based
programming which focuses on the problem of medical image processing and visualization. FW4SPL consists in a set of cross-platform C++ libraries : core
and component. Components are highly modular and are very loosely coupled
between them.

The goal of FW4SPL is to provide a unified set of basic features to be
used in medical imaging and to facilitate the share and combination of
developments around medical imaging research.

We try to reuse the maximum number of FLOSS projects to avoid reinventing existing  tool and library. The toolchain to build is complex and we have created a dedicated
project to build this set: sconspiracy (available on
http://code.google.com/p/sconspiracy). With this tool, we can use traditional C++
libraries in FW4SPL (apr, icu, libxml2, boost, qt, wxwidgets...) and domain
specific C++ libraries (itk, vtk, gdcm, opencv, sofa, OpenNI ...).

## Why is your organization applying to participate in GSoC 2011? What do you hope to gain by participating ##

Medical software is a very complex process that requires well-designed and
broad functionalities. We believe that there is a strong need for a free and
open-source framework for efficient development of research and clinical
software prototypes integrating contributions from all communities.

We hope to attract potential contributors to the FW4SPL project, and in the
process:
  * we hope to attract new members in our community via our participation.
  * we hope to introduce new students to free software in general.
  * we hope to gain a few new mind-blowing features.
  * we hope to integrate the results of GSoC as soon as possible.

## What criteria did you use to select the individuals who will act as mentors for your organization ##

The volunteering mentors all have:
  * Enthusiasm and availability.
  * Many years of experience with our code.
  * Some have academic teaching experience or experience managing a remote
team or participant

## What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students ##

We want to start cooperating with the students as soon as possible to be
able to see their commitment to the task even before choosing them for the
project.

All students can use our integration farm, trac ticket server, intermediate
mercurial server and wiki server. These tools should help monitor the
activities and motivate students. Students will be pushed to publish their
results in a dedicated DVCS branch, so that in case something goes wrong, it
is clearly visible and we can work with the student to fix this issue. This
strategy has been validated in the four previous years with trainees working
on this project.

Obviously, motivation and studentsâ€™ qualities must be evaluated correctly.
Our estimations are going to be based on the following criteria:

  * Familiarity and experience with sub-project technologies
  * Students should be able to prove their programming skills
  * Students should be able to prove their communication capacities

In case a student cannot deliver good enough results, we are not going to
drop all the work she/he has been able to do; Source code and documentation
will be kept (in a dedicated DVCS branch and in the wiki). Money invested in
the project by Google will not be completely lost.

## What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors ##

The selected mentors are well known and connected in the community. We
estimate the risk of a disappearing mentor to be low. All selected mentors
are long time developers of the project with big motivation. In case this
would happen, other project developers shall replace the member. We intend
to nominate co-mentors who will act as a mentor in the absence of one.

## What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program ##

Throughout the coding period, mentors will encourage students to make their
in-development code available for comment and review on a regular basis. We
will organize a weekly meeting with the mentor and the student. As we
quickly integrate the student effort into the codebase, she/he will rapidly
get feedback from the community and this should motivate her/him more to go
on.

## If you are a small or new organization applying to GSoC, please list a larger, established GSoC organization or a Googler that can vouch for you here ##

FW4SPL is a very small project. However this project has partly been funded
by the European Commission: http://www.passport-liver.eu

You can also find Skuld project available on http://blog.skuld-project.net/ based on FW4SPL.

## If you are a large organization who is vouching for a small organization applying to GSoC for their first time this year, please list their name and why you think they'd be good candidates for GSoC here ##

N.A.

## Anything else you'd like to tell us ##

Long life to GSoC !
