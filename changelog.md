  * Added mergeMask Image helper.

Dump management :
  * Added an implementation of fwTools::IBufferManager with fwMemory::BufferManager : This implementation purpose is to manage memory load, freeing memory and restoring freed buffers as needed. A dump policy is used to trigger memory freeing process. The restore process is always triggers when a lock is requested on a dumped buffer. Available policies are :
    * NeverDump : This policy will never take the initiative to free memory. This is the policy used when no automatic memory management is wanted. Memory will be dumped on demand.
    * AlwaysDump : This policy will dump buffers as often as possible. As soon as a buffer is released (ie the lock count become zero), it will be dumped.
    * BarrierDump : This policy defines a memory usage barrier and will try to keep the managed buffers memory usage under this barrier.
    * ValveDump : This policy is monitoring system memory usage and will trigger memory dump when the amount of system free memory is lower than the minFreeMem parameter. An hysteresis parameter exists to free more memory when the process is triggered. If the free system memory amount is lower than the minFreeMem, this policy will try to reach minFreeMem + hysteresisOffset bytes of free memory.

  * Updated darwin memory tool : take in account inactive memory as free memory
  * Activated _BarrierDump_ during fwXML serialization if fwMemory::BufferManager with NeverDump policy is used.

BufferObject / IBufferManager
  * Added fwTools::BufferObject : Base class for FW4SPL buffers. Keep a pointer to a buffer and it's allocation policy (new or malloc) without any cleverness about allocating/destroying the buffer. Users of this class needs to take care about allocation and destruction by themselves. BufferObject class has a BufferManager and Locks mechanism, Allowing to trigger special treatments on various events on BufferObjects (allocation, reallocation, destruction, swapping, locking, unlocking) (see doxygen for more information).
  * Added fwTools::IBufferManager : Provides interface for a buffer manager. A BufferManager is able to hook BufferObjects actions an to change it's behaviors. (see doxygen for more information)
  * Updated fwData::Array to use fwTools::BufferObject
  * Added new helper fwdata::ObjectLock : a simple helper to lock specific object, manages : Image, Mesh, Array, Reconstruction and Acquisition.
  * Removed few critical methods of basic structures (fwData::Array, fwData::Mesh and fwData::Image) according to buffer lock mecanism. These methods are now proposed by helpers (fwComEd::helper::Array, fwComEd::helper::Mesh, fwComEd::helper::Image) and manage buffer lock process.
  * Support buffer lock process in many helpers/services ( MeshGenerator, vtk conversion, itk conversion, serialization, etc )

New Services :
  * New service _SPatientDBInserter_ (io::IWriter type) that allow to push a structure (patientDB, patient, study, acquisition or image) in a patientDB.
If destination pdb is not configured, a dialog box proposes to select a pdb from an active pdb list ( pdb registered in OSR ).

New samples :
  * Added new example Ex01VolumeRendering to show different services that use or manipulate a TF.
  * Added new example Ex03Registration to show a registration between points by using ARLCore.

Issues :

  * Fixed clang/icc compilation
  * Fixed import fxz (fields in few structures were not managed).
  * Fixed issue with last table color in fwVtkWindowLevelLookupTable.
  * Fixed selected acquisition index in PatientDBGuiSelectorService.
  * Fixed problem with message callback when service is destroyed in uiImageQt/WindowLevel.
